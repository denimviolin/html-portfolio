<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have a Master's and Ph.D. in music theory, and I teach music theory at Ohio University.</p>

<p>I am learning coding on my own as a fun project. I've always loved puzzles, and coding is one puzzle after another!</p>

<p>Once I finish the Udemy bootcamp, I will also learn Elm.</p>
